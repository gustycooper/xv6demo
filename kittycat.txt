This is the text in the file kittycat.

Soft kitty, warm kitty, 
little ball of fur! 
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, 
purr purr purr!
Xv6 kitty, Xv6 kitty,
grrr, grrr, grrr!

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
"When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when"
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

A long tailed cat sitting by the old rocking chair
Now he don't realize that there's a danger there
But he don't care no rock 'n' roll chair is gonna boogie on his day
'Cause when his tail took a low down, syncopate, yeah
